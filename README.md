# Welcome to my landing page project! 👋🏻 

#### This is my very first project within the professional web development track.

## Intro

This involves a _dynamic webpage_ with **four sections** and a **navigation bar** at the top to navigate to each section individually with the help of javascript, **smoothly scroll to each section** using the navigation bar while making it clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the web page by **Highlighting the navbar links and sections**.

## Tasks accomplished: 🗓️

🔘 Create dynamic navigation links through JS. ✅

🔘 Click on navigation links to scroll to the corresponding section. ✅

🔘 Highlight active class in the console as soon as the section is within our viewport ✅

🔘 Highlight both sections and links when each are within viewport ✅

## Notes: 📑

🟢 I've supplied my code with as much **comments** as i could so i would make it quite easy for everyone to interpret this code.

🟢 I've made some changes to the fonts here and there in the css file, made the navbar and footer's backgrounds transparent for a smoother look.

🟢 I've switched up the content within each section to breath some life into it and also added an additional 4th section.

🟢 I've added a hover color transition to the paragraphs and headings.

### Some missing requirement from the previous submission:

🔵 I've updated the javascript code by including 2 let variables . **(updated)**

🔵 Highlighted both sections and both links. **(updated)**

🔵 Formatted my JS file on JS Beautify. **(updated)**
