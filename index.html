            This is the landing page project and Hopefully my experience shows.
            I id some altercations to this page as you can clearly see and i'm
            excited to share with you how far i have really come.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this project we'll turn this static page into a dynamic one with
            the help of javascript. We'll navigate through sections through
            clicking on links provided in the navbar and do much more.

            My name is Ibrahim (just call me Abe). I am 23 years of age and i
            live in the country of Egypt. Yes! pyramids, sphinx, mummies(seen
            some of those...didn't end well), thousand year old manuscripts,
            obelisks ....deserts, reeeaally hot summers and...camels?! But wait!
            there's always more to it than that!
          </p>

          <p>
            The best thing about my country is...(drum roll)...it's own people!!
            They are some of the kindest people on earth. yes, we can be quite
            mad at times but hey, it happens to everyone. Take away all the
            noise and you'll come to conclusion that egyptians are really caring
            and generous, just like their forefathers. If there is something
            unique about us then it is definitely our smile. It can light up the
            hearts of many and hopefully it'll do so to your's as well.

            Previously, i had graduated from the foundational web development
            course and i couldn't have been happier! I tried to look elsewhere
            for a challenge and then i came across this track. Heard some were
            saying it was quite challenging and so here i am.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is my goal to pass this course with flying colors and hopefully
            have a chance at joining the advanced web development track. Now
            that's quite the challenge!! I'm still contemplating which cross
            skilling program should i go with? React development or Angualr...
            Either way, i'm sure i'll get the right amount of knowledge i need
            to someday be where i belong.

            I aspire to be a future full-stack developer. It is my dream job and
            i will do whatever it takes to reach that goal. It might consume a
            bit of time and sweat but eventually i'll get there!

            Looking for a job can be quite difficult sometimes, especially if
            you're a fresh graduate. I'll have to pick up some pace if i ever
            wanted to stand out. This is a challenging environment, each one of
            us acquires unique set of skills and it's up to me entirely if i
            wanted to craft something entirely different and unique so i would
            mark my spot before leaving this world.
